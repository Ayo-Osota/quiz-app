    "question": "What is the purpose of Boolean operators in Python?",
    "options": [
      "To perform mathematical calculations",
      "To evaluate conditions and return True or False",
      "To concatenate strings",
      "To define variables"

    "correctAnswer": "To evaluate conditions and return True or False",
    "explanation": "Boolean operators evaluate conditions and return True or False, enabling decision-making in programs."

      "match statement",
      "case statement",
      "select statement"

      "None",
      "Error"

      "number ** 2 == 0"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "number % 2 == 0",
    "explanation": "To check if a number is even, use the modulus operator: number % 2 == 0. If the remainder is 0, the number is even."

  {
    "id": 8,
    "question": "What is the difference between == and = operators?",
    "options": [
      "== assigns a value, = compares values",

      "Both do the same thing",
      "== is for strings, = is for numbers"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "== compares values, = assigns a value",
    "explanation": "The == operator is used for equality comparison (returns True/False), while = is the assignment operator (assigns a value to a variable)."

      "Only for variables",
      "Only for keywords"

    "correctAnswer": "Yes, 'Hello' and 'hello' are different",
    "explanation": "Python is case sensitive, meaning 'Hello' and 'hello' are considered different strings."

      "Functions",
      "Comments"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Boolean expressions that evaluate to True or False",
    "explanation": "If statements use Boolean expressions that evaluate to True or False to determine which code block to execute."

    "question": "In match statements, what happens when no case matches?",
    "options": [
      "An error is raised",
      "The program terminates",
      "The default case (_) is executed if present",
      "The first case is executed"

    "correctAnswer": "The default case (_) is executed if present",
    "explanation": "Match statements can have a default case using the underscore (_) that executes when no other case matches."

      "True",
      "False",
      "None",
      "Error"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "True",
    "explanation": "The 'or' operator returns True if at least one of the conditions is True. True or False evaluates to True."

    "question": "Which statement describes real-world decision making that programs need to emulate?",
    "options": [
      "Programs never need to make decisions",
      "Programs need to decide which code to run and which to ignore based on conditions",
      "Programs always run all code",
      "Programs only make random decisions"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Programs need to decide which code to run and which to ignore based on conditions",
    "explanation": "Since programs solve real-life problems involving decisions (like 'Should the next level be unlocked?'), they need to make decisions about which code to run."
