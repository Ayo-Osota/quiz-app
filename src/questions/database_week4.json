    "id": 2,
    "question": "How does the Compare & Contrast method work?",
    "options": [
      "It uses JOIN keyword explicitly",
      "It compares values in a given table against another using WHERE clause",
      "It uses HAVING clause",
      "It requires a subquery"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "It compares values in a given table against another using WHERE clause",
