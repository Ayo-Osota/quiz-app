    "id": 5,
    "question": "If two PCs are placed in different VLANs on the same switch but no inter-VLAN routing is configured, what is the expected result when attempting to ping between them?",
    "options": [
      "Ping will succeed because the switch forwards across VLANs",
      "Ping will fail because VLANs are isolated at Layer 3",
      "Ping will be broadcast to all VLANs",
      "Ping will be forwarded by CDP"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Ping will fail because VLANs are isolated at Layer 3",
    "explanation": "Different VLANs are separate Layer 3 networks; without a router or Layer 3 device providing inter-VLAN routing, hosts in different VLANs cannot reach each other."

      "Both server and client can create VLANs",
      "Client is used to secure VTP updates and server forwards them"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Server can create/modify VLANs; client only replicates VLANs",
    "explanation": "A VTP server can create and modify VLANs; a VTP client cannot create VLANs and only receives synchronized VLAN information from servers."

    "question": "VTP is proprietary to which vendor?",
    "options": ["Juniper", "Arista", "Cisco", "Huawei"],

      "ip address trunk",
      "vlan trunk enable"

      "vtp secret <password>",
      "vtp password <password>",
      "vtp set password <password>",
      "vtp enable-password <password>"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "vtp password <password>",
    "explanation": "Use 'vtp password <password>' to set a VTP password so switches exchange VTP updates only if they share the same password."
  },
  {
    "id": 12,
    "question": "After configuring Switch1 as VTP server with VLANs created and Switch2 as VTP client with the same domain and password, what should happen?",
    "options": [
      "Switch2 will ignore Switch1 and keep its own VLANs",

      "Switch2 will become a VTP server automatically"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Switch2 will receive and replicate VLANs from Switch1",
    "explanation": "A VTP client synchronizes its VLAN database with the VTP server when domain and password match, replicating VLANs created on the server."

    "id": 13,
    "question": "What is the main benefit of dynamic routing protocols in a network?",
    "options": [
      "They manually set static routes for all paths",
      "They automatically discover and update best paths between networks",
      "They replace the need for routing tables",
      "They prevent any topology changes"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "They automatically discover and update best paths between networks",
    "explanation": "Dynamic routing protocols automatically exchange routing information and update routing tables to find best paths and adapt to network changes."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Distance-vector protocol using hop count; 15 hop limit; RIPv1 and RIPv2 versions",
    "explanation": "RIP is a distance-vector protocol that uses hop count as its metric, has a 15-hop maximum, and comes in RIPv1 and RIPv2 versions."

    "options": [
      "OSPF is distance-vector; EIGRP is link-state",
      "OSPF is link-state with fast convergence and suited for large networks; EIGRP is a Cisco-enhanced (hybrid) protocol using metrics like bandwidth and delay",
      "Both OSPF and EIGRP are proprietary to Cisco",
      "EIGRP uses hop count only and cannot load balance"

    "correctAnswer": "OSPF is link-state with fast convergence and suited for large networks; EIGRP is a Cisco-enhanced (hybrid) protocol using metrics like bandwidth and delay",
    "explanation": "OSPF is a link-state protocol often used in large networks and converges quickly. EIGRP is Cisco-developed (hybrid) using metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and supports features like load balancing and uses topology and routing tables."
