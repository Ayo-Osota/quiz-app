      "CPU scheduler",
      "Job scheduler",
      "Memory scheduler",
      "Network scheduler"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Job scheduler",
    "explanation": "The Long-term scheduler is also known as the job scheduler. It chooses processes from the pool (secondary memory) and keeps them in the ready queue in primary memory."
  },
  {
    "id": 9,
    "question": "What is the purpose of the Short-term scheduler?",
    "options": [
      "To manage long-running background tasks",
      "To select one job from the ready queue and dispatch it to the CPU for execution",
      "To manage disk space",
      "To handle network connections"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "To select one job from the ready queue and dispatch it to the CPU for execution",
    "explanation": "The Short-term scheduler (CPU scheduler) selects one job from the ready queue and dispatches it to the CPU for execution. Its selection is critical as a long-running job can cause others to wait."

    "question": "How does Round Robin (RR) scheduling work?",
    "options": [
      "Processes run until completion",

      "Only high-priority processes run",
      "Processes are selected randomly"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "It reserves a fixed amount of time for each process; if not complete, the process is blocked and moved to end of queue",
    "explanation": "Round Robin is a proactive scheduling algorithm that reserves a fixed time slice for each process. If a process doesn't complete within the time, it's blocked and added to the end of the queue."

    "id": 14,
    "question": "What is Priority Scheduling based on?",
    "options": [
      "The order processes arrive",

      "Random selection",
      "Alphabetical order of process names"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Process type, importance, or resource requirements",
    "explanation": "Priority Scheduling assigns priority to each process, and the process with the highest priority is executed first. Priority can be set based on process type, importance, or resource requirements."

    "correctAnswer": "Job Queue, Ready Queue, Waiting Queue",
