    "question": "Why are errors a concern in programming?",
    "options": [
      "Errors never occur in well-written code",
      "Errors can and do occur at any stage when a program runs and users are unpredictable",
      "Errors only occur during compilation",
      "Errors can be completely prevented"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Errors can and do occur at any stage when a program runs and users are unpredictable",
    "explanation": "Errors can occur at any stage and it's impossible to anticipate every error. Users are unpredictable and may use programs in unexpected ways."

      "Prevents exceptions from occurring"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Executes always, regardless of whether an exception occurred",
    "explanation": "The finally block executes always, whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used for cleanup operations."

      "ValueError",
      "IndexError",
      "ListError"
    ],

    "question": "Given: try: num1=int(input()); num2=int(input()); print(num1); print(num2); except ValueError: print('Invalid input'); finally: print('Code complete'). What prints if inputs are 10 and 'xyz'?",
    "options": [
      "10, xyz, Code complete",
      "Invalid input, Code complete",
      "10, Invalid input, Code complete",
      "ValueError, Code complete"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Invalid input, Code complete",
    "explanation": "When 'xyz' is entered, ValueError is raised on the second input. The except block catches it and prints 'Invalid input', then finally always prints 'Code complete'."

    "id": 10,
    "question": "What is the Exception class in Python?",
    "options": [
      "A specific type of error",
      "The base class for all exceptions",
      "A function for handling errors",
      "A module for error logging"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "The base class for all exceptions",
    "explanation": "Exception is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. Catching Exception catches most errors."

    "question": "Can exceptions occur across function calls?",
    "options": [
      "No, exceptions are limited to the function where they occur",
      "Yes, exceptions can propagate up through function calls",
      "Only if explicitly passed as parameters",
      "Only in global scope"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Yes, exceptions can propagate up through function calls",
    "explanation": "Exceptions can propagate up through function calls. If not caught in a function, the exception bubbles up to the calling function."
  },
  {
    "id": 13,
    "question": "What happens if you don't catch an exception?",
    "options": [
      "The exception is ignored",
      "The program continues normally",
      "The program terminates with an error",
      "The exception is automatically handled"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "The program terminates with an error",
    "explanation": "If an exception is not caught, the program will terminate and display an error message showing the exception type and traceback."
  },
  {
    "id": 14,
    "question": "Can you have multiple except blocks for different exception types?",
    "options": [
      "No, only one except block is allowed",

    "options": [
      "Your code is always responsible for all errors",
