    "correctAnswer": "SELECT column1 AS alias FROM table",
    "explanation": "The AS keyword is used to create an alias for a column. Example: SELECT lastName AS surname FROM Person."

    "id": 2,
    "question": "Is the AS keyword required when creating column aliases?",
    "options": [
      "Yes, AS is always required",

      "Yes, but only in MySQL",
      "No, it's deprecated"

    "correctAnswer": "SELECT column1, expression FROM table",
    "explanation": "You can create calculated columns using expressions. Example: SELECT amount, amount * 10 FROM Payment."
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "question": "Why should you use AS with calculated columns?",
    "options": [
      "It's required for calculations to work",
      "To give the calculated column a meaningful name",
      "To improve query performance",
      "To enable sorting on the column"

    "question": "What does SELECT DISTINCT do?",
    "options": [
      "Selects only the first row",

      "Sorts the result set"

    "correctAnswer": "Removes rows with redundant values from the result set",
    "explanation": "DISTINCT removes duplicate rows. Example: SELECT DISTINCT provinceCode FROM Person returns unique province codes."

      "SELECT ... ASCENDING column"

    "question": "Is ASC required in ORDER BY for ascending order?",
    "options": [
      "Yes, ASC must always be specified",
      "No, ASC is the default and can be omitted",
      "Yes, but only in older SQL versions",
      "No, but it's required for descending order"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "No, ASC is the default and can be omitted",
    "explanation": "ASC is the default sorting order and is rarely used in practice. ORDER BY lastName is equivalent to ORDER BY lastName ASC."

      "Orders by firstName within lastName",
      "Orders randomly"

    "correctAnswer": "Orders by firstName within lastName",
    "explanation": "Multiple columns in ORDER BY create nested sorting. Results are sorted by lastName first, then by firstName within each lastName group."

      "Orders firstName descending only",
      "Creates an error because an alias is used"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Orders lastName descending, then firstName ascending within each lastName",
    "explanation": "You can mix ASC and DESC for different columns. lastName is sorted descending, while firstName is sorted ascending (default) within each lastName."
