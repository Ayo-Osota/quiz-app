    "question": "What is a function in Python?",
    "options": [
      "A type of variable",
      "A group of code that performs a specific task and runs only when called",
      "A built-in operator",
      "A comment style"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A group of code that performs a specific task and runs only when called",
    "explanation": "A function is a group of code that performs a specific task and runs only when it is called. It's like having a mini program within your larger program."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "question": "What are the two types of functions in Python?",
    "options": [
      "Static and dynamic functions",
      "Built-in functions and user-defined functions",
      "Public and private functions",
      "Sync and async functions"

    "correctAnswer": "Built-in functions and user-defined functions",
    "explanation": "There are built-in functions (pre-created like print() and round()) and user-defined functions that you create yourself."

    "id": 3,
    "question": "How do you define a function in Python?",
    "options": [
      "function my_function():",
      "def my_function():",
      "func my_function():",
      "define my_function():"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "def my_function():",
    "explanation": "Functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parentheses: def my_function():"
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "question": "What are parameters in a function?",
    "options": [
      "Return values from the function",
      "Values passed to the function when it's called",
      "Local variables inside the function",
      "Comments in the function"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Values passed to the function when it's called",
    "explanation": "Parameters are values that are passed to a function when it is called, allowing the function to work with different data."
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "question": "What does the return statement do in a function?",
    "options": [
      "Ends the program",
      "Sends a value back to the caller",
      "Prints a value to the console",
      "Defines a new variable"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Sends a value back to the caller",
    "explanation": "The return statement sends a value back to the code that called the function. It can be done on the same line as the calculation."
  },
  {
    "id": 6,
    "question": "What happens to code written after a return statement with the same indentation?",
    "options": [
      "It executes normally",
      "It will not execute",
      "It executes only if return is False",
      "It executes before return"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "It will not execute",
    "explanation": "Writing anything after return with the same indentation will not execute because the function exits at the return statement."
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "question": "What is the scope of a local variable?",
    "options": [
      "Available throughout the entire program",
      "Only available within the function where it's defined",
      "Available in all functions",
      "Available only in imported modules"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Only available within the function where it's defined",
    "explanation": "Local variables are only available within the function where they are defined. They cannot be accessed outside that function."
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "question": "What is the scope of a global variable?",
    "options": [
      "Only available in one function",
      "Available throughout the entire program",
      "Only available in imported modules",
      "Not available in functions"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Available throughout the entire program",
    "explanation": "Global variables are defined outside functions and are available throughout the entire program, including inside functions."
  },
  {
    "id": 9,
    "question": "How can you mimic overloaded function behavior in Python?",
    "options": [
      "By creating multiple functions with the same name",
      "By using *args and len()",
      "By using global variables",
      "Python doesn't support this"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "By using *args and len()",
    "explanation": "Python can mimic overloaded function behavior by using *args to accept variable numbers of arguments and len() to check how many were passed."
  },
  {
    "id": 10,
    "question": "What is an example of a built-in function in Python?",
    "options": [
      "my_custom_function()",
      "print()",
      "custom_calculator()",
      "user_input()"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "print()",
    "explanation": "print() is a built-in function that has been pre-created in Python and is available for immediate use."
  },
  {
    "id": 11,
    "question": "Can you return a value on the same line as the calculation?",
    "options": [
      "No, you must use a separate variable first",
      "Yes, return x + y is valid",
      "Only for simple additions",
      "Only with the return keyword on a separate line"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Yes, return x + y is valid",
    "explanation": "You can return a value on the same line as the calculation. Instead of 'res = x + y; return res', you can write 'return x + y'."
  },
  {
    "id": 12,
    "question": "What should function comments describe?",
    "options": [
      "Only the return value",
      "The function's purpose, parameters, and return value",
      "Only the parameters",
      "Function comments are not necessary"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "The function's purpose, parameters, and return value",
    "explanation": "Function comments should describe what the function does, what parameters it accepts, and what it returns to make code more maintainable."
  },
  {
    "id": 13,
    "question": "What is the output of: def my_print(message, n): while n > 0: print(message, end=' '); n -= 1 followed by my_print('a', 4)?",
    "options": [
      "aaaa",
      "a a a a",
      "a 4",
      "aaaa4"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "a a a a",
    "explanation": "The function prints 'a' 4 times with a space after each (due to end=' '), resulting in 'a a a a '."
  },
  {
    "id": 14,
    "question": "Why are functions useful in programming?",
    "options": [
      "They make code slower",
      "They allow code reuse and organization",
      "They are required by Python",
      "They prevent errors"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "They allow code reuse and organization",
    "explanation": "Functions allow you to organize code into reusable pieces that can be called whenever needed, making programs more modular and maintainable."

  {
    "id": 15,
    "question": "What happens when you call a function?",
    "options": [
      "The function is defined",
      "The function's code is executed",
      "The function is deleted",
      "Nothing happens"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "The function's code is executed",
    "explanation": "When you call a function, the code inside that function is executed. The function only runs when it is called."
