      "A collection of application software",
      "The physical structure of a computer"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A layer of software that manages a computer's resources for its users and their applications",
    "explanation": "An Operating System is a layer of software that manages a computer's resources for its users and their applications, including the kernel and system programs."

    "question": "What is the kernel in an operating system?",
    "options": [
      "A user application program",
      "The software that is always running and has complete control over everything in the system",
      "A network protocol",
      "The graphical user interface"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "The software that is always running and has complete control over everything in the system",
    "explanation": "The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system."

    "question": "What are the two spaces an OS is divided into?",
    "options": [
      "Application Space and Hardware Space",
      "Kernel Space (privileged mode) and User Space (user mode)",
      "Memory Space and Disk Space",
      "Network Space and Local Space"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Kernel Space (privileged mode) and User Space (user mode)",
    "explanation": "The OS is divided into Kernel space (privileged mode for core OS functions) and User space (user mode for user applications and processes with restricted hardware access)."

    "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary purpose of an operating system?",
    "options": [
      "Allocate resources between different applications",
      "Provide an interface that abstracts the details of accessing hardware",
      "Create hardware components",
      "Provide common services like network and disk device access"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Create hardware components",
    "explanation": "Operating systems manage software and hardware resources but do not create hardware components. They allocate resources, provide hardware abstraction, and offer common services."

    "question": "What role does the BIOS play in a computer system?",
    "options": [
      "It manages user applications",
      "It provides the initial program that runs when the computer starts, before the OS loads",
      "It encrypts all data on the hard drive",
      "It manages network connections"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "It provides the initial program that runs when the computer starts, before the OS loads",
    "explanation": "The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is the firmware that initializes hardware during the boot process before loading the operating system."

    "question": "What does the OS sit between?",
    "options": [
      "The monitor and keyboard",
      "Users/applications and lower-level computer firmware/hardware",
      "The CPU and RAM only",
      "The hard disk and network"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Users/applications and lower-level computer firmware/hardware",
    "explanation": "The OS sits between users/applications and the lower-level computer firmware/hardware, managing access to system resources like CPU, memory, storage, and devices."

  {
    "id": 7,
    "question": "Which mode does the kernel run in?",
    "options": [
      "User mode",
      "Supervisor mode",
      "Application mode",
      "Network mode"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Supervisor mode",
    "explanation": "The kernel runs in supervisor mode (also called privileged mode), which gives it complete control over system resources, while user applications run in user mode with restricted access."

  {
    "id": 8,
    "question": "What are the key components of an operating system?",
    "options": [
      "Only the graphical interface",
      "The kernel, system programs, and applications",
      "Just the device drivers",
      "Only network protocols"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "The kernel, system programs, and applications",
    "explanation": "Operating systems include the kernel (always running), system programs (associated with the OS), and support for applications (all other software)."
  },
