    "question": "What is the purpose of the provided SQL script in the notes?",
    "options": [
      "To create network VLANs",
      "To create two tables (employees and departments) with a relationship for demo purposes",
      "To configure a router-on-a-stick",
      "To export NetFlow records"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "To create two tables (employees and departments) with a relationship for demo purposes",

    "options": [
      "All rows from the left table with NULLs for unmatched right rows",
      "All rows from the right table with NULLs for unmatched left rows",
      "The Cartesian product of both tables",
      "Only records with matching values in both tables (the intersection)"

    "correctAnswer": "Only records with matching values in both tables (the intersection)",
    "explanation": "INNER JOIN returns only rows where the join condition matches in both tables — the intersection of the two sets."

    "question": "Given the INNER JOIN example results (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Eve), which employee is implicitly excluded from that INNER JOIN?",
    "options": ["Alice", "David", "Eve", "Charlie"],
    "correctAnswer": "David",
    "explanation": "David is excluded because his department_id is NULL (or has no matching department), so INNER JOIN omits him."
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "question": "When should you use an INNER JOIN according to the notes?",
    "options": [
      "When you need the union of both tables",
      "When you need only the intersection of data (rows present in both tables)",
      "When you want all rows from the left table regardless of matches",
      "When you want the Cartesian product of both tables"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "When you need only the intersection of data (rows present in both tables)",
    "explanation": "The notes advise using INNER JOIN when you want only matching rows present in both tables."

    "options": [
      "All records from the right table and matching left records",
      "All records from both tables, removing duplicates",
      "All records from the left table and matching records from the right table; unmatched right columns are NULL",
      "Only records with matches in both tables"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "All records from the left table and matching records from the right table; unmatched right columns are NULL",
    "explanation": "LEFT JOIN returns every row from the left table and the matching rows from the right; where no match exists, right-side columns are NULL."
  },
  {
    "id": 6,
    "question": "In the LEFT JOIN example, why is department_name NULL for David?",
    "options": [
      "Because David's salary is too low",
      "Because David's department_id is NULL or has no matching department record",
      "Because LEFT JOIN always returns NULL for the last row",
      "Because department_name was not selected in the query"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Because David's department_id is NULL or has no matching department record",
    "explanation": "David's department_id is NULL (or lacks a matching departments entry), so LEFT JOIN returns the left row with NULL for the right table's columns."
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "question": "What does a RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN) return?",
    "options": [
      "All records from the left table only",

      "Only matching records from both tables",
      "The Cartesian product of both tables"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "All records from the right table and matching records from the left table; unmatched left columns are NULL",
    "explanation": "RIGHT JOIN mirrors LEFT JOIN semantics but returns every row from the right table with matching left-side rows where present; otherwise left columns are NULL."
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "question": "What does a CROSS JOIN produce?",
    "options": [
      "Only matching rows between two tables",

      "The Cartesian product: each row from table A combined with every row from table B",
      "Only rows from the right table"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "The Cartesian product: each row from table A combined with every row from table B",
    "explanation": "CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product; every row of the first table is paired with every row of the second, which can produce very large result sets."
  },
  {
    "id": 9,
    "question": "Which caution applies when using CROSS JOINs?",
    "options": [
      "They remove all NULL values automatically",
      "They always perform better than INNER JOIN",
      "They can produce extremely large result sets because they pair every row from each table",
      "They automatically create index keys"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "They can produce extremely large result sets because they pair every row from each table",
    "explanation": "CROSS JOIN multiplies row counts from both tables and can quickly generate huge datasets, so use with care."
