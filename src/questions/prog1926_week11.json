      "A type of string method"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "The character or string that separates substrings",
    "explanation": "A delimiter is the character or string used to determine where to split the string. For example, ',' is the delimiter in 'a,b,c'.split(',')."

  {
    "id": 13,
    "question": "Are strings in Python mutable or immutable?",
    "options": [
      "Mutable - you can change characters in place",
      "Immutable - you cannot change characters in place",
      "Depends on the string length",
      "Depends on the Python version"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Immutable - you cannot change characters in place",
    "explanation": "Strings in Python are immutable. You cannot change individual characters. String methods return new strings rather than modifying the original."

      "'ytho'",
      "'Pyth'"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "'yth'",
    "explanation": "String slicing [1:4] extracts from index 1 (inclusive) to index 4 (exclusive). In 'Python', this gives 'yth' (indices 1, 2, 3)."
