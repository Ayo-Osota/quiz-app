    "question": "What is the difference between static and sticky MAC address configurations for port security?",
    "options": [
      "Static is encrypted; sticky is unencrypted",
      "Static requires manual entry of MACs; sticky allows the switch to learn and retain MACs dynamically",
      "Static works only on routers; sticky works only on firewalls",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Static requires manual entry of MACs; sticky allows the switch to learn and retain MACs dynamically",
    "explanation": "Static port security means you manually configure allowed MAC addresses; sticky lets the switch learn MACs from connected devices and save them as secure entries."
