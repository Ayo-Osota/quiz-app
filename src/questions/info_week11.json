    "question": "When a device in one VLAN wants to communicate with a device in another VLAN, to which network element does it send the packet?",
    "options": [
      "The destination device's MAC address directly",
      "Its default gateway (router or Layer 3 switch)",
      "A broadcast address on the local VLAN",
      "The switch management interface"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Its default gateway (router or Layer 3 switch)",
    "explanation": "Inter-VLAN traffic is sent to the device's default gateway (a router or Layer 3 switch), which routes the packet to the destination VLAN."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "question": "What does the router or Layer 3 switch consult to determine the best path to the destination VLAN's IP address?",
    "options": [
      "ARP table",
      "MAC address table",
      "Routing table",
      "VLAN database"

    "question": "Which device can perform both switching and routing functions and is often used for scalable inter-VLAN routing?",
    "options": ["Layer 2 Switch", "Hub", "Layer 3 Switch", "Access Point"],
    "correctAnswer": "Layer 3 Switch",

    "id": 7,
    "question": "If hosts on different VLANs are connected to a switch but no router or Layer 3 device is configured for inter-VLAN routing, what is the expected result when attempting to ping across VLANs?",
    "options": [
      "Ping succeeds immediately",
      "Ping fails because the networks are isolated",
      "Ping is forwarded by the switch's MAC table",
      "Ping is broadcast to all VLANs"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Ping fails because the networks are isolated",
    "explanation": "Without inter-VLAN routing (router or Layer 3 switch), VLANs are isolated at Layer 3 and hosts on different VLANs cannot reach each other."

    "question": "What is the purpose of Cisco's Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)?",
    "options": [
      "Automatically negotiate trunk links between two switches",
      "Encrypt trunk traffic between switches",
      "Dynamically assign IP addresses to VLANs",
      "Aggregate multiple physical links into one logical link"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Automatically negotiate trunk links between two switches",
    "explanation": "DTP negotiates trunk links between directly connected Cisco switches, enabling multiple VLANs to be carried over the link."
  },
  {
    "id": 9,
    "question": "Why is it considered best practice to disable DTP on production switch ports?",
    "options": [
      "DTP is deprecated and no longer works",
      "DTP can be a security risk if left enabled",
      "DTP prevents VLAN tagging",
      "DTP consumes excessive CPU on switches"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "DTP can be a security risk if left enabled",
    "explanation": "DTP can allow unauthorized trunk formation or VLAN hopping; disabling it (e.g., with switchport nonegotiate) reduces attack surface."

    "id": 10,
    "question": "Which DTP mode is passive and will only become a trunk if the neighbor actively negotiates a trunk?",
    "options": ["Dynamic desirable", "Dynamic auto", "Trunk", "Access"],
    "correctAnswer": "Dynamic auto",
    "explanation": "Dynamic auto is a passive DTP mode: the interface will become a trunk only if the neighbor actively negotiates (e.g., dynamic desirable)."

    "question": "Which DTP mode actively tries to negotiate a trunk with the neighboring device?",
    "options": ["Access", "Trunk", "Dynamic auto", "Dynamic desirable"],

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Configure int range fa0/1-4, use channel-group 1 mode active, then configure interface port-channel 1 and set switchport mode trunk",
    "explanation": "To configure EtherChannel with LACP: put the member ports in an interface range, run channel-group <num> mode active, then configure the resulting Port-Channel interface (e.g., set it to trunk)."
