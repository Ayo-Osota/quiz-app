    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Radio transmissions are an open medium and can be intercepted by anyone in range",
    "explanation": "Wireless signals broadcast through the air, making them accessible to attackers within range; this openness increases the attack surface compared to physical wired links."

    "question": "What distinguishes EAP-TLS from PEAP for 802.1X authentication?",
    "options": [
      "EAP-TLS uses only passwords while PEAP uses certificates",
      "EAP-TLS relies on client and server digital certificates and TLS; PEAP generally uses a server TLS tunnel plus user credentials",
      "PEAP provides stronger security because it uses AES directly",
      "EAP-TLS cannot be used with 802.1X"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "EAP-TLS relies on client and server digital certificates and TLS; PEAP generally uses a server TLS tunnel plus user credentials",
    "explanation": "EAP-TLS requires mutual certificate-based authentication (client and server), which is considered very strong; PEAP typically uses a server certificate and user credentials inside the TLS tunnel."
