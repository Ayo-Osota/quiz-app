    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Students can enroll in many courses, and each course can have many students",
    "explanation": "When multiple instances of one entity relate to multiple instances of another, it is a many-to-many relationship (often implemented with a join/associative table)."

  {
    "id": 8,
    "question": "What is the role of a foreign key in a relational database?",
    "options": [
      "To store large binary files",

      "To create indexes automatically"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "To enforce a reference from one table to a primary key in another table",
    "explanation": "A foreign key creates a link between tables and enforces referential integrity by referencing a valid primary key in the related table."
  },
  {
    "id": 9,
    "question": "What does 'referential integrity' ensure regarding foreign keys?",
    "options": [
      "That every table has a primary key",
      "That foreign key values correspond to existing primary key values in the referenced table",
      "That queries run faster",
      "That schema changes are automatically propagated"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "That foreign key values correspond to existing primary key values in the referenced table",
    "explanation": "Referential integrity prevents orphaned references by ensuring foreign keys match existing primary key values (or are NULL if allowed)."

      "Two crow's feet at both ends",
      "A single line at both ends",
      "A dashed line"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A crow's foot at one end and a single line at the other",
    "explanation": "A crow's foot at the 'many' end and a single line at the 'one' end visually indicates a 1:N relationship in ER diagrams."

      "Composite attribute",
      "Derived attribute",
      "Primary key attribute"

    "options": [
      "To store system configuration",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "To implement a many-to-many relationship by linking two entities and possibly holding relationship attributes",
    "explanation": "Associative (junction) entities convert M:N relationships into two 1:N relationships and can store attributes about the association."
