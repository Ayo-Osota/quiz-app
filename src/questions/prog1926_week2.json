    "question": "What does casting a float to an int do to the value in Python?",
    "options": [
      "Rounds the value to the nearest integer",
      "Drops the decimal portion of the value",
      "Adds .0 to the value",
      "Raises a ValueError"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Drops the decimal portion of the value",
    "explanation": "Casting a float to an int will not round the value, but instead drop the decimal portion. For example, int(12.9) returns 12."

      "80",
      "8"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "5.0",
    "explanation": "Following BODMAS rules, division and multiplication are evaluated left to right: 2 / 4 = 0.5, then 0.5 * 10 = 5.0. The result is a float."

      "8",
      "1"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "7",
    "explanation": "The // operator is floor division, which returns the integer quotient without the remainder. 15 // 2 = 7."

    "question": "What happens when Python performs an operation on an int and a float?",
    "options": [
      "It raises a TypeError",
      "It converts both to strings",
      "It performs implicit type conversion to float",
      "It converts both to int"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "It performs implicit type conversion to float",
    "explanation": "Python performs implicit data type conversion by converting to the type that offers no loss of information. When int and float are used together, the result is a float."

      "Always rounds down",
      "Rounds toward the nearest even number",
      "Randomly chooses up or down"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Rounds toward the nearest even number",
    "explanation": "Python 3 rounds to the nearest even number when the value is exactly 5. For example, 11.5 rounds to 12 (even) and 10.5 rounds to 10 (even)."
